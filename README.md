This repo is forked from the SuperDARN/control_programs repo. Here this repo will
contain radar specific changes in order to easily deploy control program changes
to the radars.  Radar specific code will be stored on *branch_base*-*radar*.
For example, the interleavesound branch for Fort Hays will be stored on:
interleavesound-fhr


Note from original repo:

This repository contains an archive of requested non-standard Special Time (ST)
and Discretionary Time (DT) radar control programs. Please contact the radar
control program author or experiment requester with any questions.
